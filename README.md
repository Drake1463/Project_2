Overview 
Reading a data file, fitering on a user specified mass and year.  The filtered data is displayed on the screen as well as a subset of the data is printed to files.

Summary
Enter a mass and a Minimum Year Limit between 0 and 2022.  Press the Apply Filters button.  This will filter the dataset for the input data.  
Filtered data subset is output to the respective file and the full details of the filtered dataset are output to the fields on the GUI.
Close the GUI by hitting the Exit button or pressing the x in the top right corner.

Everything works on the program and everything is completed.

I changed the ordering of the fields on the GUI to improve usability because users start at the top and read down.  Hitting the apply button will display the data below.
If the filtered dataset is too large, the program takes a long time to execute.
